# AOODGamePad

## Overview
AOODGamePad is a custom-built interactive game controller project developed as part of the Advanced Object-Oriented Design curriculum. It integrates both hardware interfacing and software control logic to simulate a responsive and user-friendly gamepad interface.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate principles of encapsulation, inheritance, event handling, and modular design within a real-time input environment.

## Features
- Button and joystick input handling
- Real-time event-driven response system
- Object-oriented class structure for scalable input mapping
- Clean and modular design for future hardware or software extension
- Console output or graphical representation of input status (based on implementation)

## Technologies Used
- Java (or language of choice)
- Object-Oriented Design principles
- GUI framework (e.g., JavaFX or Swing) or terminal-based interface
- Optional: Arduino/Python for hardware integration

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
3. Compile and run `Main.java`.
4. Follow on-screen instructions or interact with the UI.

## Future Enhancements
